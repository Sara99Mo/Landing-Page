## Instructions
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Developer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
This project developed by Sara Mohamed Al-Farghly.

## Introduction
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
This project has a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
For this project, you will be writing most of your code in `js/app.js`. Note that it's very important that _you plan your project_ before you start writing any code! Break your project down into _small_ pieces of work and strategize your approach to each one. With these bite-sized amounts, it'll be easier to debug and fix any issues that appear.

**Feel free to implement your own design workflow.**
